_A lazy sketch of myself._

_Hello World!_

My name is **Lý Trí Đức**, pronounced as _Lee Tree Duke_, though I'm happy to be called _Mike_ or _Lee_. But I'm not what matters, so you can find out more about me in [my personal website](https://ductrl.github.io), or you can contact me in linked socials on the left column of your screen (you may have to scroll down).\

# About Blee

**Blee** is my corner of the internet, where I'll share to the world about what I find interesting. The name _Blee_ is the result of my lack of creativity and combination between _blog_ and _Lee_.

I am not a good writer, not an experienced blogger and doesn't have English as my first language. However, I find no harm in having fun while practice writing, which is why I decided to write blog. Blogging is a hobby that I recently picked up; I also write Vietnamese blog in the Vietnamese version of _Blee_ - [BleeVN](https://bleevn.github.io).

As for the content on the website, a lot of what I write will be related to **Artificial Intelligence**, **Psychology** and **Music** as those are my fields of interest. Though, the content will of course not be limited to such topics.

Finally, I know my limited writing ability will confuse English readers a lot, but I hope you will find my content intriguing and helpful. I'll always be excited to discuss my work, to hear any feedbacks (especially grammar and spellings related) and suggestions, so please do not refrain from contacting me.

_Best_,

**_Lý Trí Đức_**
